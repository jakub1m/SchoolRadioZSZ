Welcome to **SchoolRadioZSZ**—an innovative automated school radio project that transforms how music is enjoyed at our school. This repository contains three key components, working in harmony to create a seamless and automated radio experience.

## 🌟 Project Overview

  - Content cleaning and filtering 🧹
  - Sentiment analysis via an adaptable API 🔍

  - Seamless integration with the sentiment analysis module 🔗

### 3. Admin Page
- **Description**: A sleek web interface for administrators to manage song content and monitor system activity. Features include manual song acceptance/rejection, sentiment analysis logs, and remote control over the music playback system.
- **Features**:
  - Manual song moderation ✨
  - Log viewing and management 📊
